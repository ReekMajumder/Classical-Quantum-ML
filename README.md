# Classical-Quantum-ML
This is the first version of classical Quantum Machine Learning model using Pennylane.
The goal is to successfully implement Binary classificaltion using classical quantum machine learning model for images.

# Concepts used 
Transfer Learning (Resnet 18) -> Reducing Feature space of images
Variational Classifier Quantum Algorithm -> to provide quantum layer for classification

# Impact of adversarial attack
Another goal for this project to implement Adversarial attack on both classical and hybrid model.
And study the impact of classical known defences on classical and hybrid model.

# Future Goal
Develop a Quantum algorithm which can work on reducing the impact of adversarial attack.
